### Install Requirements
- PHP 7 (Recommend PHP 7.1). However, it will also work with PHP 5.6, but it has not been tested yet.
- Write permission has to be granted into the complete `data/` directory except `data/config` folder.

### Installing from zip
1. Click `Clone or download`
2. Unpack the archive and rename the `Scriptor-master` folder as you like.
3. Upload the contents of the folder to your server, or upload the folder if you want to run the application in a subfolder.

> NOTE: If you want to use Scriptor in a subdirectory, you might have to adjust the .htaccess file.

### Admin
Once installed, to access the administrator area of your Scriptor site go to your websites homepage, then simply add the text `editor/` to the URL in your browsers, for example: 
```
https://yourwebsite.com/editor/
```

If you are using Scriptor in a subdirectory: 
```
https://yourwebsite.com/scriptor/editor/
```
