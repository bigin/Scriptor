# Scriptor

_Scriptor is a simple flat-file CMS_   
A lightweight flat-file CMS that allows you to get started with minimal effort and time investment.

## Features   
#### Get started quickly: 
Intuitive, user-friendly control panel helps you get up and running easily â€“ you will have it installed in the blink of an eye.   

#### A flexible and extensible architecture:
You have a variety of options and a powerful [ItemManager](https://github.com/bigin/ItemManager-3) API for module development.

#### You have total freedom:
Themes and modules can contain plain HTML/PHP code - Scriptor does not restrict the user's development approach with a mandatory template engine.


### Install Requirements
- A Unix or Windows-based web server running Apache.   
- PHP 7.4 or newer (8.0 preferable).   
- Write permission has to be granted into the complete `data/` directory except `data/config` folder.   
- Apache must have mod_rewrite enabled.   
- Apache must support .htaccess file.   
    
### Installing from zip

2. Unpack the archive and rename the `Scriptor-master` folder as you like.
