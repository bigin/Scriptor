- Write permission has to be granted into the complete `data/` directory except `data/config` folder.

### Installing from zip
1. Click `Clone or download`
2. Unpack the archive and rename the `Scriptor-master` folder as you like.
3. Upload the contents of the folder to your server, or upload the folder if you want to run the application in a subfolder.

> NOTE: If you want to use Scriptor in a subdirectory, you might have to adjust the .htaccess file.
