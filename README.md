# Scriptor

_Scriptor is a simple flat-file CMS, based on [ItemManager 3](https://github.com/bigin/ItemManager-3) - 
decoupled and reusable PHP library for web applications._   

## Features   
Get started quickly and easily: Intuitive, user-friendly control panel helps you get up and running quickly. 
You will have it installed in 2 minutes - ready to use.   

Flexible features extensible architecture: You have a variety of options and a powerful [ItemManager](https://github.com/bigin/ItemManager-3) 
framework for module development.

by a mandatory template engine.
