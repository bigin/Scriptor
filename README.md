To access the admin panel, go to the home page of your website and simply add the text `editor/` to the URL in your browser:

```
https://your-website.com/editor/
```
  

If you are using Scriptor in a subdirectory:

```
https://your-website.com/subdirectory/editor/
```

### Admin initial login

`(!) Change password/username at first login`

> User: `admin`   
> Password: `gT5nLazzyBob`


## Use Scriptor as a library

To make the Scriptor library available in your own project, simply include the `boot.php` file:  

```php
require  './your-scriptor-project/boot.php';
```


or use composer autoload:

```php
require  '../vendor/autoload.php';
```
 

Now you can just add Scriptor in your own code:

```php
<?php  // /public/index.php

use Scriptor\Core\Scriptor;

require  dirname(__DIR__) .  '/vendor/autoload.php';

$site  =  Scriptor::getSite();
$page  =  $site->getPage('slug=scriptors-demo-page');
```
