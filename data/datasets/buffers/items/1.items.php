Scriptor is a simple flat-file CMS based on IManager. Specially developed for publishing web-based manuals, instructions or API references and other online publications, supports Markdown.

The Scriptor&nbsp;provides everything&nbsp;you need to get&nbsp;started with online publishing, but none of the features and complexity that are unnecessary.

#### Open Source
Scriptor is released under the MIT license. You can run, copy, distribute, change and improve it to suit your needs.

#### What kind of publications can you create with Scriptor?
In short,&nbsp;all types of publications&nbsp;that&nbsp;contains static text, for instance:
- Manuals  
- Tech&nbsp;How-To Guides&nbsp;&amp; Tutorials  
- API references  
- Simple static websites  
- Blogs&nbsp; 
- And much more  

&gt; Note: Scriptor is not suitable for complex dynamically generated data structures or large scale&nbsp;websites with large volume of data.

#### Flat File
Installation and deployment is much easier, without the need to setup a database. No configuration required: Unzip, upload and create your contents in seconds.

#### Markdown only  
Scriptor\'s entire article editor pretty much built around Markdown! Scriptor supports Markdown&nbsp;syntax only, because that\'s a cool thing, makes writing easier and thus avoid unnecessary content bloat. By the way, Scriptor also supports syntax highlighting:

```php
include \'ConfigHandler.php\';
```

#### Design
If you are HTML guru or even be good on it - feel free to create your own design or to&nbsp;customize&nbsp;an&nbsp;existing template `site/theme/template.php`. Scriptor does not use its own template engine but uses plain HTML/PHP, which makes working with it very easy.

#### Extendable
Since the Scriptor is based on [IManager](https://gitlab.com/bigin1/imanager) framework, it allows you to add any extra functionality.

#### Language
Scriptor supports different languages for the admin panel. You can install or create alternate language packs for the admin of Scriptor. The English and German language files&nbsp;can be found in `editor/lang/` folder. You can change your language preference for the admin section within your&nbsp;`data/settings/scriptor-config.php` file.',
