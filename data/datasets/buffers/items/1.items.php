The Scriptor provides everything you need to get started with online publishing, but none of the features and complexity that are unnecessary.

#### Open Source
Scriptor is released under the MIT license. You can run, copy, distribute, change and improve it to suit your needs.

#### What kind of publications can you create with Scriptor?
In short, all types of publications that contains static text, for instance:
- Manuals  
- Tech How-To Guides & Tutorials  
- API references  
- Simple static websites  
- Blogs  
- And much more  

> Note: Scriptor is not suitable for complex dynamically generated data structures or large scale websites with large volume of data.

#### Flat File
Installation and deployment is much easier, without the need to setup a database. No configuration required: Unzip, upload and create your contents in seconds.

#### Markdown only  
Scriptor\'s entire article editor pretty much built around Markdown! Scriptor supports Markdown syntax only, because that\'s a cool thing, makes writing easier and thus avoid unnecessary content bloat.

And by the way, Syntax Highlighting is also supported:
```php
include(\'/your-imanager-location/imanager.php\');
```
#### Design
If you are HTML guru or even be good on it - feel free to create your own design or to customize an existing template `site/theme/template.php`. Scriptor does not use its own template engine but uses plain HTML/PHP, which makes working with it very easy.

#### Extendable
Since the Scriptor is based on [IManager](https://gitlab.com/bigin1/imanager) framework, it allows you to add any extra functionality.

#### Language
Scriptor supports different languages for the admin panel. You can install or create alternate language packs for the admin of Scriptor. The English and German language files can be found in `editor/lang/` folder. You can change your language preference for the admin section within your `data/settings/scriptor-config.php` file.
